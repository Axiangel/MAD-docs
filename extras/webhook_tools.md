## PoracleJS

PoracleJS is based on running a Discord or Telegram bot that will either send events to a group/channel or as a private message to you. So every user can set their own filters. Poracle is able to send Pokémon, Eggs/Raids and Quests.

## novabot

Novabot is a Discord bot that doesn't actually use webhooks. It pulls the data directly from the database. Just like Poracle, novabot is configurable for each user individually. It's able to post Pokémon, Eggs/Raids and has a raid coordination system built in.
